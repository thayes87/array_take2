#How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
*I am feeling about a  out of 10 with arrays. While I do understand some of the methods used to call arrays, I am still working to understand
the context in which they would be used. For instance, when using .pop, why would someone want to remove just the last element AND remove it for future use? I'm sure there are a million great examples out there and I'm excited to dig into it a little more when time allows.*

#Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
*This is now the 3rd time I have completed this exercise due to some typos made while committing work. I feel like I can move on to the next lesson now with confidence.

#What questions do you have about Arrays?
*See question 1. Most of my questions are surrounding the context of the method, these answers will come as I continue exploring more methods.
